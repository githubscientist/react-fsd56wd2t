[x] What is the hook?

Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.

Why we need hooks?

Hooks essentially enable you to write stateful functional components, which means you can write components in a more functional style and avoid using class components.

Normal Variable Vs State Variable

- normal variable is used to store the data which will not cause the re-render of the component.
- state variable is used to store the data which will cause the re-render of the component.
