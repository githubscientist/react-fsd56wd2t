### React - Day -4: React components

[x] Components - In-depth

#### What is a component?

A component is a reusable piece of code that can be used to build elements of a user interface. Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single application can have any number of components. Components can be nested within other components to allow for complex user interfaces to be built out of simple building blocks.

#### Types of components

There are two types of components in React:

1. **Functional components** - These are the simplest form of a React component. They are just JavaScript functions that return a React element. They are also called stateless components because they do not manage state.

2. **Class components** - These are more complex than functional components. They are JavaScript classes that extend the `React.Component` class. They are also called stateful components because they can manage state.

[x] Stateful and stateless components

Stateful components are components that manage state. They are also called class components because they are implemented as JavaScript classes that extend the `React.Component` class. Stateful components can manage state and have access to lifecycle methods.

State:

- State refers to the data that a component manages. - It is an object that contains data that is used to render the component.
- State is mutable, which means that it can be changed over time.
- It allows a component to keep track of changes to its data and re-render itself when the data changes.
