### React - Day -4: React components

[] Components - In-depth

#### What is a component?

A component is a reusable piece of code that can be used to build elements of a user interface. Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single application can have any number of components. Components can be nested within other components to allow for complex user interfaces to be built out of simple building blocks.

#### Types of components

There are two types of components in React:

1. **Functional components** - These are the simplest form of a React component. They are just JavaScript functions that return a React element. They are also called stateless components because they do not manage state.

2. **Class components** - These are more complex than functional components. They are JavaScript classes that extend the `React.Component` class. They are also called stateful components because they can manage state.
