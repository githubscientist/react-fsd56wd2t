## React- Day -6: Router

react-router-dom

- its a package to handle routing in react.
- it is used to navigate between different components.
- it is used to create single page application.
- Traditionally, we use anchor tag to navigate between different pages in web application. But the problem with anchor tag is that it will refresh the page and it will make the application slow. Also, the back button will not work properly.
